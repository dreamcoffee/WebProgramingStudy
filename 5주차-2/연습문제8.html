    <h3>5G (Wikipidia)</h3>
    <p>5G networks are cellular networks, in which the service area is divided 
        into small geographical areas called cells. All 5G wireless devices 
        in a cell communicate by radio waves with a cellular base station via 
        fixed antennas, over frequency channels assigned by the base station. 
        The base stations, termed gNodeBs, are connected to switching centers 
        in the telephone network and routers for Internet access by 
        high-bandwidth optical fiber or wireless backhaul connections.</p>
